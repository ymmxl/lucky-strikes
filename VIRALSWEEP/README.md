## ‚ú® Features

- **High-Volume Entry**: Submit thousands of entries to maximize winning chances
- **User Agent Rotation**: Uses diverse browser fingerprints to avoid detection
- **Smart Email Generation**: Creates realistic email variations using multiple formats
- **Multi-threaded Architecture**: Distributes requests across multiple parallel processes
- **Proxy Support**: Compatible with residential and datacenter proxies
- **Interactive Controls**: Exit functionality to gracefully stop the entry process
- **Configurable Timing**: Adjustable sleep times between submissions to avoid rate limits
- **Robust Logging**: Detailed logs for successful and failed entries

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

VIRALSWEEP Bot works through a streamlined process:
1. Loads configuration, proxy settings, and user agents
2. Generates randomized user information and emails
3. Submits entries to the ViralSweep API endpoints
4. Uses staggered timing to avoid detection
5. Tracks successful entries in detailed logs

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- Faker
- InquirerPy
- Brotli (for response processing)
- User agent list

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Configure your `config.json` with:
   - Address templates
   - Thread count and timing parameters

2. Prepare proxies in `proxies.txt` (one per line)

3. Ensure `user_agents.txt` contains a variety of browser user agents

4. Run the raffle entry bot:
```bash
python app.py
```

## üìä Workflow

1. Bot loads configuration, proxy data, and user agents
2. Creates a queue of entry tasks based on configured amount
3. Launches multiple threads to process the queue
4. Each thread:
   - Generates a random user profile and email
   - Selects random shoe size
   - Submits entry to ViralSweep API
   - Logs results and sleeps according to configuration
5. Results logged to `Entered.txt` and `Failed.txt`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `config.json` file controls key parameters:

```json
{
  "address": [
    {
      "address1": "## #pre#13 Ash%var=.,-,'%f%var=0,o%rd BC",
      "address2": "166 ## Feltham #suff#",
      "zip": "",
      "city": "",
      "state": ""
    }
  ],
  "maxthread": 2,
  "amount": 30000,
  "time_sleep": 30,

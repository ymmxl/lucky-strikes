## üîí Security & Environment Setup

### Setting Up Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to securely manage sensitive information like API keys:

1. Copy the `.env.template` file to create your own `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and add your own values:
   ```
   CAPTCHA_API_KEY="your_captcha_service_key"
   NOTRE_SITEKEY="captcha_site_key"
   ```

3. The `.env` file is excluded from git through `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of credentials.

### Security Precautions

- **Never commit sensitive information** directly in the code
- **Never share your `.env` file** with others
- If you've accidentally committed sensitive information, change your credentials immediately
- Use template files for configuration with placeholder values

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raffle.git
cd raffle

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your actual credentials
```

## ‚ú® Key Features Across Systems

- **Platform-Specific Optimization**: Each bot is individually tailored to its target platform
- **Address Randomization**: Built-in address jig functions for varied, legitimate-looking submissions
- **Multi-threaded Architecture**: High-volume entry capabilities across all systems
- **Proxy Support**: Compatible with residential and datacenter proxies
- **Email Management**: Various email handling techniques from catchalls to verification
- **Captcha Handling**: Integration with solving services where required
- **Robust Logging**: Detailed logs for monitoring performance

## üìã Common Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- Faker
- Proxy lists
- Various platform-specific dependencies

## üîç Implementation Notes

The SACAI and MONKEY bots, while now obsolete due to website redesigns, showcase particularly robust methodologies:

1. **SACAI's Multi-Stage Approach**:
   - Account creation with randomized information
   - Email inbox monitoring for verification links
   - Automated link extraction and verification
   - Raffle entry with size selection
   
   This flow demonstrates a complete end-to-end solution for platforms requiring verified accounts.

2. **MONKEY's Form Intelligence**:
   - Dynamic form parsing and question analysis
   - Intelligent question answering
   - Answer selection interfaces for quick configuration
   
   This methodology showcases how to handle complex, variable form structures.

The utils/ directory contains shared tools utilized across multiple systems, particularly for address manipulation, proxy handling, and other common functions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Inspiration for Development

While some systems are now obsolete due to website changes, the methodologies and approaches remain valuable for developers interested in:

- Web automation techniques
- Form submission strategies
- Captcha handling processes
- Multi-threaded request management
- Detection avoidance methods

The code is structured to be educational and inspirational rather than immediately operational on current platforms.

## üß™ Technical Learning Opportunities

Each bot in this suite demonstrates different technical approaches:

- API interaction vs. form submission
- Session management and cookie handling
- Request timing and threading models
- User agent rotation and fingerprinting
- Proxy implementation strategies
